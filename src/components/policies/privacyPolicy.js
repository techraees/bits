        <p>
          The information we collect when you use BITS NFT may be categorized as
          personal information or non-personal information. While personal
          information (such as your name, email address, and profile photo) is
          any information that can be used to identify you as an individual,
          non-personal information is the opposite. We may collect both types of
          information in 2 major ways. These include:

          The information you may provide us may include your name, email

        <p>
          Cookies are tiny pieces of information that are attached to your
          device browser upon your access to the website. We use them on the
          website for certain activities, including remembering users when they
          come back to the website, identifying user preferences and the
          features they interact with, monitoring the website for violations of
          our <a href="">Terms and Conditions</a> and applicable laws, and
          performing certain features and functions.
          <br />
          <br />
          In addition to cookies, we may use other technologies, including
          pixels, beacons, clear gifs, and tags on our content to enable us to
          monitor which user takes action on specific content. <br />
          <br />
          The cookies on the website are embedded in your browser directly by
          us. However, our third-party service providers may also embed cookies
          on your browser to enable them to perform their services (for example,
          Google embeds cookies in Google Analytics to enable them to track and
          gather analytics).
          <br />
          <br />
          While some cookies exist for a browsing session and expire when you
          close your browser (session cookies), others stay longer and may exist
          between minutes to years – depending on their set expiry dates
          (persistent cookies).

          You have a choice to reject or accept cookies. You can reject cookies

        <h1>Google Analytics and Other Tools</h1>
        <p>
          We use certain third-party APIs and tools, such as{" "}
          <a href="">Enjin</a>’s SDK and
          <a href="">Google Analytics</a> for analytics gathering. Enjin is a
          third-party service that helps us with developing tools, data storage,
          and other features that make creating NFTs possible.
          <br />
          <br />
          Google Analytics is a third-party tracking and analytic gathering tool
          from <a href="">Google Inc</a>., which we use to gather information
          about traffic and the behaviors and preferences of users on the
          website. Google Analytics mostly collects anonymous information, but
          this information may include your device’s IP address.
          <br />
          <br />
          The analytic information collected through these tools helps us to
          personalize BITS NFT, analyze usage trends, secure the website, and
          help us with adverts that improve BITS NFT.
          <br />
          <br />
          Like cookies, you can opt out of Google Analytics tracking by
          installing the Google Analytics Opt-out browser <a href="">
            add-on
          </a>{" "}
          on your browser. This add-on instructs the Google Analytics JavaScript
          (ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.js) running on websites to prohibit
          sending information to Google Analytics.

          at least one or more legal or lawful basis.
          <br />
          <br />
          We rely mostly on your consent with the information you submit to us.
          This means that we will not collect and use such information unless
          you have shown that you want us to collect it (for example, where you
          provide your email address in the newsletter form). <br />
          <br />
          Aside from consent, we collect other information, such as your date of
          birth, location, and IP address to satisfy our legitimate interest,
          including monitoring the website for violations, securing BITS NFT,
          identifying users, preventing bots and other malicious activities,
          improving BITS NFT, and managing legal issues.
          <br />
          <br />
          In other circumstances, we collect personal information to fulfill our
          contractual obligation – to provide you with the service you have
          requested.
          <br />
          <br />
          Lastly, we collect certain information (for example, your transaction

          We take the security of your personal information very seriously. We
          have implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures in
          protecting it from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, or
          destruction. These measures may include, without limitation, (i) using
          complete data protection features within our database, (ii) not
          storing your crypto wallets, which allows you to self-custody, (iii)
          not selling your information to third parties for them to advertise to

          However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of

          request the deletion of your registration information, we will retain
          it on our database for 1 year after your request. This is needed for

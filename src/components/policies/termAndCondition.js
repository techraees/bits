            <p>
              The website is a crypto-based P2P marketplace that allows users
              (mostly dancers) to own and monetize their dance moves. Users can
              create, mint, and register their dance moves on the blockchain
              through NFTs, as well as sell, transfer, and purchase NFTs to and
              from other users. <br />
              <br /> We are not a crypto exchange, wallet provider, financial
              institution, or broker, nor are we in the money service business
              or serve as a creditor. We do not hold custody of your NFTs or
              crypto wallets, they all exist on the blockchain. We do not engage
              in the sale of NFTs on the website – we only provide a marketplace
              that connects creators and buyers. All activities revolving around
              NFTs are solely user-based. When you connect your wallet address
              to BITS NFT, we do not have access to the funds and tokens you
              have in that wallet. Furthermore, we are not a party to any
              agreed-upon terms and conditions between you and any other user
              with respect to an NFT. By engaging in a transaction, you release
              us from all liabilities resulting from the legitimacy,
              authenticity, identity, and verifiability of the NFTs. <br />
              <br />
              If you use BITS NFT to create and monetize NFTs, you warrant to us
              that you have the right and licenses to the NFT art or that you
              have written permission from the NFT art owner to use them on your
              NFT. <br />
              <br />
              If you are purchasing NFTs on BITS NFT, you agree that your
              ownership right is limited to the NFT you purchase and not the NFT
              art. The only license you have in an NFT art is provided to you
              under these Conditions. You further agree that no information
              provided by us about an NFT is to be considered professional or
              legal advice. We do not endorse any NFT for authenticity,
              marketability, reliability, or legitimacy.{" "}

              By purchasing or trading NFTs through BITS NFT, you acknowledge
              that there are some risks associated with owning NFTs.
              <br />
              <br />
              You hereby agree that:
            </p>
            <li>
              The value of an NFT is subject to demand and supply and market
              forces and they are volatile in nature. Market fluctuations may
              materially affect the price, which may cause it to decrease below
              your expectations; thus, making you lose some or all of your
              money.
            </li>
            <li>
              A lack of public interest in the development of a distributed
              ecosystem could impact the development of such ecosystems
              negatively, thus impacting their utility negatively.
            </li>

            <li>
              The laws and policies governing NFTs, blockchains, and
              cryptocurrencies are uncertain for now, and new laws and policies
              may affect the utility of your purchased NFTs adversely.
            </li>
            <li>
              We may, at any time, be under a regulatory inquiry or action,
              which may limit or impede your ability to access and use BITS NFT.
            </li>
            <li>
              The crypto world is a progressing/developing industry and
              technical advances – such as the development of quantum computers
              – may pose some risks to smart contracts or your NFTs, which may
              result in their exploitation, theft, or loss.
            </li>
            <li>
              You further understand that the trading of digital assets, such as
              NFTs, has potential risks and rewards. You understand that trading
              NFTs is not suitable for everyone and that you may lose your funds
              at any time subject to market demand and supply.

            </li>

            <p>
              In no event shall we or any of our suppliers, employees,
              directors, partners, agents, and affiliates be liable for any
              damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data
              or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use
              or inability to use BITS NFT, even if we have been notified orally
              or in writing of the possibility of such damage.
              <br />
              <br />
              Notwithstanding, if we are found liable for any losses by a court
              having competent jurisdiction, our maximum liability shall not
              exceed the sum of $100 or the total fees you paid to us in the
              past 6 months before the claims – whichever is greater. <br />
              <br />
              Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied
              warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or
              incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.

              officers, agents, and employees) harmless from any claims,
              demands, losses, damages, issues, costs, and expenses, including

                  These Conditions and all aspects of BITS NFT shall be governed
                  by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
                  Arizona, US, without regard to conflict of law and its
                  provisions. With respect to any disputes not subject to
                  informal resolution or binding arbitration (as described
                  below), you agree not to commence or prosecute any action
                  other than in the State and Federal courts located in the
                  State of Arizona. You hereby consent to and waive all defenses

                  If we are unable to settle a dispute informally for at least
                  30 days, either of us may elect to have the dispute settled by
                  binding arbitration subject to the terms described herein
                  (excluding the exceptions stated below). Any election to
                  arbitrate by a party shall be binding on the other party. The
                  arbitration shall be commenced and conducted in line with the
                  Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
                  Application (AAA), and where applicable, the AAA’s
                  supplementary procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (AAA
                  Consumer Rules). Both rules may be found on the AAA’s website
                  at <a href="">www.adr.org.</a> The decision of a dispute being
                  qualified for arbitration shall be determined using the
                  Federal Arbitration Act in a court rather than by an
                  arbitrator. Your arbitration fees and share of the arbitration
                  compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules. The
                  arbitration may be conducted through the submission of
                  documents, in person, by phone, or online by mutual agreement.
                  The arbitrator shall pass judgment in writing but need not
                  provide reasons unless either party requests. If the
                  arbitrator does not follow applicable laws, either party may
